# MarxToken
The fairest and most nonfunctional currency 

Made by kesy for SDHacks 2017 Nanome Blockchain Hackathonception challenge

The Marx Token is at token deployed on the Ropsten Test Ethereum Network.

There are currently a fixed 11.2 billion units of Marx, one for each of Earth's future 
11.2 billion (the current prediction for Earth's max population).

What makes the Marx Token unique is that no account can have more than one Marx at a time and
the unit cannot be further subdivided since its decimal place is set to 0.

At any given time each account on the Ethereum network can hold either 1 or 0 Marx except for 
the creators account which curerntly holds all 11.2 billion.

This may seem like the worlds worst case of income inequality, but on the contrary, since 
each account can only ever have at most 1 Marx, no matter how many Marx the creator has
their usable value to another person will only ever be 1 Marx.

This restrication on transaction and flow of Marx makes it a very impractical and mostly 
non functional form of currency and in practice I am confident people will find other forms
of currency.

Unfortunatly since the Marx is not deployed on the Main Ethereum Network (because that costs 
real people money) it cannot be traded on the main network, but you can still try it out on 
the Ropsten Test Network from the contract address: 0x789e150aa256b81835fcec9cf75258ebcad92453
